# freeCodeCamp Microservice APIs

APIs were created for the freeCodeCamp [Apis and Microservices Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jhoover4/apis-and-microservices).
FCC teaches in javascript, but these APIs were created using Flask, with the FCC projects as inspiration.

Details for each API and endpoints are [documented](https://jh-fcc-backend-apis.herokuapp.com) in the app. Find details 
on each individual API below.
